# remotelab
Scripts to automate some tasks on my remote lab, for my personal use.

the select_samples.py creates a subinterface based on parameters found on sample file.

Provisioning folder will contain some scripts to automate repetitive tasks for ONU testing. (Maybe this will evolve in a backend for OLT management?)

Pretend to support:
Cianet G8PSX (in development)
ZTE C300/C320 
Cianet G8PS
Fiberhome RP1000
